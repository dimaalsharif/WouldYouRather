## About would you rather project

This project lets the user try the 'would you rather' game experience. Starting with the sign in step as one of 3 user options, followed by viewing the lists of answered and unanswered 'would you rather' questions; which are basically two-option questions and the user has to choose one of them. Also, the user can either see the final vote results of the answered questions, or submit their own answer and see its result directly. In addition to the option of creating a brand new question, view the leaderboard with the name and score of the top active user. All the user needs to do to use this React App, is to run 'install npm' and 'npm start' respectively.
